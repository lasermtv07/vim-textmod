# vim-textmod

A dumb vim extension that sorta works like those translators to fake translators to fake *"languages"* that are usually just the input weirdly modified. This extension is (like another five of my projects) **WIP**, so more stuff is coming. Currently, it takes input from VIM selection and prints it to the console. It currently supports these modifiers:

- **Text to BrainFuck** - command `:PrintBrainfuck` - converts text to valid brainfuck code
- **Text Uwufier** - command `:PrintUwuified` - makes text look more uwu - replaces some charaters and adds some text. Look into the source code. And no, **I dont have a problem**. However, **you do**.

*more coming in the future*
